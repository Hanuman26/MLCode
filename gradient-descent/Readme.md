# Simple Gradient Descent implementation over linear regression

Requires python 2.7
Requires Numpy and matplotlib

Figure shows the final plot over the scattered data(x,y) with learning rate =0.0001 and 1000 iterations 

Output gives the final value of b and m for y = m*x + b

Prints value of total iteration and value of b and value of m and error.

Example - 
Starting gradient descent at b = 0, m = 0, error = 5565.10783448
********************************************************
After 2000 iterations b = 0.148355127549, m = 1.47657623056, error = 112.579490734
